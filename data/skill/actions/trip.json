The physics are inescapable - their feet fly out from under them with violent force. Time seems to slow as shock registers on their face. Then gravity reasserts itself with brutal authority. They crash to the ground with bone-jarring impact, the fall so hard it raises dust. They lie there, stunned and prone, while you stand over them in perfect balance!",

The combination is devastating and inescapable. Their legs are swept clean out from under them, and they flip backward through the air before slamming into the ground with terrifying force. The impact echoes. They're not just prone - they're utterly rattled!"

You swing your leg with too much power, too little control, telegraphing the move so obviously that {targetName} sees it coming from a mile away. They don't just avoid it - they practically step over your sweeping leg like it's not even there. Your momentum betrays you. You spin awkwardly, arms pinwheeling as you fight to stay upright. For one mortifying moment, it looks like you're going to trip yourself. You manage to stay standing, but barely, and you're left completely exposed!",
            "Your attempted trip is executed with such poor timing and technique that it borders on comedy. You lunge forward, leg extended at an awkward angle, clearly telegraphing your intention. {targetName} doesn't even have to try hard to avoid it - they simply shift their weight slightly and watch as you sweep at empty air. Your wild swing throws you completely off balance. You stumble forward, nearly falling, arms flailing for equilibrium. What should have been {targetName} on the ground is instead you looking like a fool!"
